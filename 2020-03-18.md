# Task Group B Activity Report to WG-Disasters
## what is this?
*A speech to be deliverd by Hidenori in the WG-Disasters VTC on 18 March 2020. Shorter will be better. Hidenori has unofficially given 10 minutes for the presentation.*

## the draft
Good evening and good morning. This is Hidenori. I am the Lead of the Task Group B. As I understand, the purpose of the Task Group B is to design and implement scenario-based exercise on emergency response and disaster risk reduction. 

In the Terms of Reference of this working group on disasters, the function of our task group is to facilitate the preparation of scenario-based exercises on different hazards. 

In order to prepare a concrete exercises on different hazards, we believe the importance of Open Source Software. We can recall Paragraph 20 of our Strategic Framework on Geospatial Information and Services for Disasters. It says: 

> A comprehensive method of managing geospatial data and information for their optimal utility by the Member States and other stakeholders is crucial in implementing the strategic framework. These include specific actitivities on data development, including collection; data standards and protocols; and data use guidelines. Modern, cost-effective and open source technologies may be to improve data and information management.

Based on this guidance by the Strategic Framework, we have many concrete and operational proposals inside our Task Group, which includes the application of the United Nations Vector Tile Toolkit developed undeer the United Nations Open GIS Initiative.

We also have some other proposals on making use of cloud-based and subscription-based services for disaster response and disaster risk reduction. 

### conference
We had many active members from Task Group B who scheduled presentations in the UN-GGIM Working Group Disasters Conference 2020 in Tokyo. Here is a list of what we prepared for the Conference: 

1. Collaboration between governmental authorities - Geocell Reinforcement Resource, by Mr. Anders Sandin from Sweden
2. Promoting regional cooperation in Asia and the Pacific to integrate geospatial information for disaster resilience, by Ms. Tiziana Bonapacce and Mr. Keran Wang from UN ESCAP.
3. Sichuan Provincial Strategic Framework in Practice, by Ms. Zhen Quanhong from China.
4. UN Open GIS agains Disasters, by Mr. Kyoung-Soo Eom from UN Open GIS Initiative, and Mr. Fujimura Hidenori from the United Nations Vector Tile Toolkit.
5. Geospatial information services of NCSCGC, and our challenges against disasters, by Mr. Farhod Omanov from Uzbekistan.
6. Common Sensing - building Climate Resilience with Small Island Nations, by Mr. Khaled Mashfiq from UNITAR-UNOSAT.
7. Geospatial Information Applications for Disaster Risk Reduction in Asia and the Pacific, by Ms. Verena Kausche from UN ESCAP.
8. Web-based disaster information shring exercise based on the Typhoon Hagibis 2019 scenario, by Mr. Nagayama Toru from Japan and Mr. Fujimura Hidenori from the United Nations Vector Tile Toolkit.
9. Mapping alongside national information management agencies for people in crisis, by Mr. Alan Mills from MapAction.
10. Use of Geospatial Information for Disaster Risk Reduction, as an interactive tabletop exercise, by again Mr. Khaled Mashfiq from UNITAR-UNOSAT.
11. Humanitarian AI-enabled ICT for field survey, evacuation, and shelter management by Mr. Kuo-Yu Slayer Chuang and Ms. Venus Chen from GeoThings.
12. Quick hands on for disaster response and evacuation management with ICT supports, by Mr. Kuo-Yu Slayer Chuang and Ms. Venus Chen from GeoThings.

So, we have prepared a lot of inputs to be on the table, but our inputs are not actually shared yet. This is our current situation. 

### next steps
As the next step, we believe that we need to put our various inputs to one table. We may need to conduct some side event or some online event to share our ideas within our Task Group, and also outside our Task Group. 

In addition, following good examples from technology-oriented colleagues in UN-GGIM, such as ISO/TC 211 and Open Geospatial Consortium, the Task Group B will have an organization account on GitHub so that we can best share our outputs. 

After these steps, we will be able to define the scenarios and hazards that we focus. We will also be able to figure out what kind of geospatial support we can offer according to scenarios. We may further be able to propose difference exercises with associated geospatial solutions.

That's all from me. Thank you so much. Over to you.
